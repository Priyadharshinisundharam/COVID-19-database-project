## 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis & Dashboard Project

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 cases using Python and visualizing the results through a Power BI dashboard. It provides insights into daily case trends, active cases, deaths, and recoveries from the provided dataset.

## 🗃️ Dataset
The dataset (cleaned_coronavirus_cases_daily_update.csv) contains daily global records of COVID-19 cases, with fields tracking various health metrics across different countries and dates. Key columns include:

- Date – The reporting date for each record
- Country – Name of the country reporting COVID-19 data
- Confirmed – Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases
- Deaths – Cumulative number of deaths due to COVID-19
- Recovered – Cumulative number of recoveries from COVID-19
- Active – Calculated as Confirmed - Deaths - Recovered, showing currently active cases

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and interactive visualizations

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps Using Python

- Removed null or irrelevant rows
- Converted Date column to proper datetime format
- Aggregated global case data by date and country

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Highlights

- Global view of COVID-19 spread
- Filters for country, year, and status (Confirmed/Recovered/Deaths)
- Line charts showing case trends over time
- Map visualizations for region-wise impact
